Welcome to my personal space! Let me start by asking you a favor: English is not my native language, and I'll try my best to avoid mistakes, but they will happen, so please bear with me :sweat_smile: . My intention here is to write small bits of knowledge, document my journey as a developer, and share my passion with you.

Hi! I'm  Simonarde Lima, nice to meet you. I've been working as a developer since 2005 :old_man: and, before that, I spent a few sleepless nights writing some mIRC scripts and trying to reproduce my mom's work using Visual Basic (yeah, my knee just squeaked here... did you hear it? hahaha).

Married with the love of my life since 2014 :heart:, today, I primarily work with PHP, JavaScript (with Vue), and Python. I also have experience with Kotlin, Dart (with Flutter), Swift, and React. In fact, I can say that I don't have any issues writing code in any language. Just give me a Monster (Mango Loco, please) and the documentation, and I'll handle it.

I know how to use MySQL and SQLite, and I know a little about PostgreSQL. I use Docker a lot! Throughout all this time, my main operating systems have been GNU/Linux (Ubuntu :heart:) and macOS.

Well, I think you now know me a little bit better, but you'll have a chance to learn more about me as you read through these pages :grin:.

See you soon! Have a nice one, and, again, sorry for the English, hahaha!
