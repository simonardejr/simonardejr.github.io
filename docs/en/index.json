Let me start by asking you a favor: English is not my native language, and I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to avoid mistakes, but they will happen, so please bear with me üòÖ . My intention here is to write small bits of knowledge, document my journey as a developer, and share my passion with you.\nHi! I\u0026rsquo;m Simonarde Lima, nice to meet you. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working as a developer since 2005 üë¥ and, before that, I spent a few sleepless nights writing some mIRC scripts and trying to reproduce my mom\u0026rsquo;s work using Visual Basic (yeah, my knee just squeaked here\u0026hellip; did you hear it? hahaha).\nMarried with the love of my life since 2014 ‚ù§Ô∏è, today, I primarily work with PHP, JavaScript (with Vue), and Python. I also have experience with Kotlin, Dart (with Flutter), Swift, and React. In fact, I can say that I don\u0026rsquo;t have any issues writing code in any language. Just give me a Monster (Mango Loco, please) and the documentation, and I\u0026rsquo;ll handle it.\nI know how to use MySQL and SQLite, and I know a little about PostgreSQL. I use Docker a lot! Throughout all this time, my main operating systems have been GNU/Linux (Ubuntu ‚ù§Ô∏è) and macOS.\nWell, I think you now know me a little bit better, but you\u0026rsquo;ll have a chance to learn more about me as you read through these pages üòÅ.\nSee you soon! Have a nice one, and, again, sorry for the English, hahaha!\n","date":"20 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/hello-world/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"First post!","title":"Hello World","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
